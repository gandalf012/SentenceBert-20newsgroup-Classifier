The following are entry points for documentation:

- the [sbert_tuning.ipynb](https://github.com/gandalf012/SentenceBert-20newsgroup-Classifier/blob/master/sbert_tuning.ipynb) contains custom loading class and training pipeline to fune-tuning distilbert models. It also help to benchmark the sBert model on dev and test with TripletEvaluator
- [ANN-Benchmarks- A Benchmarking Tool for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithms.pdf](https://github.com/gandalf012/SentenceBert-20newsgroup-Classifier/tree/master/Paper) that help to Pick an Optimal Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm. For [
